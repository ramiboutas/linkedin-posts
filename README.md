# LinkedIn Posts

Utility to share LinkedIn posts using the LinkedIn Marketing API

Made easy to use in Python.

## Installation and Setup

### Install with pip

``` sh
python -m pip install linkedin-posts
```

### Generate LinkedIn's Access Token

The quickest way to get an Access Token is by using the [LinkedIn Token generator tool](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/tools/oauth/token-generatorL)



## Usage 


### Share a post

By the time I am writing this sentence, this is the most useful function
of this package.

Share a post by using the function `share_post` with some
arguments.

``` python
from linkedin_posts.posts import share_post

response = share_post(
  "<HERE YOUR ACCESS TOKEN>",
  comment="publishing a post",
  author_type="organization",
  author_id="71513925",
)

# Do something with your response object r (http.client.HttpResponse)
# Interesting parameters to check:
# response.getheader("x-restli-id") will return the LinkedIn Post ID
# response.code will return 201 if request proccessed correctly
...
```

### Delete a post

Deleting a post is very straightforward.

Just just need the access token and pass the LinkedIn Post ID.

``` python
from linkedin_posts.posts import delete_post

response = delete_post("<HERE YOUR ACCESS TOKEN>", "urn:li:share:7104319981684674560")

# response.code will return 204 if request proccessed correctly
```

### Create a poll post

It is possible to share a post with a poll by using the following code:

``` python
from linkedin_posts.polls import share_poll

response = share_poll(
  "<HERE YOUR ACCESS TOKEN>",
  comment="Hello, this is just a test...",
  poll_question="Is this is a nice poll?",
  poll_options=["Yes", "No", "I do not care"],
  author_type="organization",
  author_id="71513925",
)

# do something with response if you need to!
```

Now go to your [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nice-cv/) and check your published poll!

### Post with media

To create a post with a nice picture you can use this code.

``` python
# upload a image
upload_request, image_urn = upload_image(
    "<HERE YOUR ACCESS TOKEN>",
    file="img/nicecv.jpg",
    author_type=author_type,
    author_id=author_id,
)

# create a post with the uploaded image
share_post_with_media(
    "<HERE YOUR ACCESS TOKEN>",
    comment="Do you like this nice cv?",
    author_type=author_type,
    author_id=author_id,
    media_id=image_urn
)
```

And voil√†. Here is your post!
